<h1>Matrix4.plot</h1>
Matrix4.plot is an open-source plugin for Eclipse <br>
It is developed by a group of students of the FH Giessen-Friedberg<br>
We are organized as an extreme programming team.


<h2>How to create a Dotplot using Matrix4.plot? </h2><br>
<br>
Matrix4.plot can create DotPlots from nearly every textbased file, including .pdf, .java, .cpp - files and much more!<br>
On the left side you can see the DotPlot Navigator. Here you can browse through your filesystem and mark the file you want to plot.<br>
You can selected single files or whole directories via checkmarks.<br>
If you want to deselect the files, simply click on the checkmarks again.<br>
In the DotPlot List you can move the files from x to y axis via drag and drop (does not work under linux motif).<br>
<br>To plot your selected files, you can either do a quicky plot by selecting quicky from the dotplot menu. <br>
Or you can go to the DotPlot Configurator by choosing the Configure DotPlot entry from the menu.
<br>
<h2>Configure Dot Plot</h2><br>

Scannersettings<br>
First you may select a scanner. You can choose from txt, java, C, CPP, PHP or no filter.<br>
A filter removes uninteresting tokens from the input file. like spaces, dots and commas from text files or common strucs from programming languages.<br>

For pdf-files there is a converter which translates pdf files to normal text. Simply check the box to use the filter. <br>
You can specify a directory where the temporary file is created. By setting the checkmark you can keep the translated text file, otherwise it will be deleted.<br>
<br>
Filtersettings<br>
On the Filtersettings tab, you can configure the filters.<br>
You can have lines instead of words as tokens. <br> You can ignore empty lines.
If you selected a filter on the other tab and pressed apply, you can manualy select tokens you don't want to see in the DotPlot in the Tokentypen box.<br>
You can specify a sentence filter to filter sentences.<br>
With the keyword filter you can choose if you want to process no keywords or just the keywords.<br>
